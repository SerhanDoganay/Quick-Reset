TODO list (no particular order):

- Great, we can play the drill. Can we stop it though?
- Start animation at any set
- Adjust performer label text size (and perhaps other settings like color and boldness as well)
- Edit field excess stuff in the FieldSettingsPanel
- Perhaps play the show music along with the drill?
- Fix the dot books to draw dots that go beyond the field bounds
- Add the count slider, and the count input (so you can view the picture at a specific count)
- Reposition the performer labels to make them easier to read (Pyware does it above or below the dot (below by default))
